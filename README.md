# Eagle CBZ/CBR Reader

A plugin for the Eagle app that provides a fast, native reading experience for CBZ and CBR comic archives directly within your library.

## Overview
This plugin integrates a dedicated comic viewer into Eagle, allowing you to read your archived comic files without needing to extract them or use an external application. It supports both CBZ (ZIP) and CBR (RAR) formats and handles high-resolution images efficiently.

## Features
- Read CBZ and CBR archives natively inside Eagle.
- Multiple reading layouts: single page, double page spread, and continuous vertical scrolling.
- Hardware-accelerated image scaling and downsampling for improved performance on large images.
- Smooth right-click drag-to-zoom and left-click panning controls.
- Automatic center-alignment for high aspect-ratio images.
- Page position tracking and restoration when reopening an archive.
- Built-in CBZ Packer utility to quickly create new archives from selected images in Eagle.
